## About the PSC

The mission of the Pok&eacute;mon Standards Consortium is to ensure the
interoperability of information related to the Pok√©mon franchise between
organizations by developing well-defined and clear standards. This is a
semi-formal, community-driven initiative that will allow for more data
portability across projects and organizations, working directly with those who
hope to benefit from the Consortium's efforts to ensure rigid standards.

## Communication

Most formal communication should be done in the GitHub Discussions for
transparency and easy tracking. Issues should be created for all Proposals, as
well as topics of discussion. Informal communication should taks place in the
PSC Discord: <https://discord.gg/f7jXyE2C4h>.

## Membership

Organizations and individuals can become members of PSC to provide input
throughout the standards process. You do not need to be a member to participate
in discussion, create a Proposal, or (most importantly) utilize the standards
documents. Voting and sponsoring/seconding a Proposal are the primary rights
granted to members.
