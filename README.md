# Pok&eacute;mon Standards Consortium

We are a group dedicated to standardizing a number of aspects of the
Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card Game and the Pok&eacute;mon video games.

Currently, we have three documents (all drafts) available:

* PSC 001: Identification of card expansions
* PSC 002: System for assigning English names to card icons
* PSC 003: Pok&eacute;paste like syntax for representing Pok&eacute;mon teams

Feel free to contribute! For more information, read the files in the
[docs/](docs/) directory.
