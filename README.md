# `standards`

This repository is where all standards documents are stored.

* Metadata about the documents is stored in the YAML metadata at the start of
  each file. For example, draft documents have `status` set to `draft`.

* For programmatic use, a GitHub action is used to convert the source documents
  to a JSON representation of them.
