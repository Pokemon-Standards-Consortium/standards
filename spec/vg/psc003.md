# PSC 003: Pok&eacute;paste like syntax for representing Pok&eacute;mon teams

## Overview

* **Scope:** Video games involving Pok&eacute;mon characters battling
* **Desired outcome:** A way to represent Pok&eacute;mon team data in text

## Definitions

* A "newline" is an ASCII LF character (`0x0A`) or two ASCII characters, CR LF
  (`0x0A 0x0D`).
* A "move" is something used by a Pok&eacute;mon that may affects the state of
  the user (the "attacker"), the recipient, or the battlefield.
* A "Pok&eacute;mon" is a playable character that may battle. It may have up to
  four moves.
* EBNF does not refer to "traditional" EBNF, but rather the EBNF defined in
	ISO/IEC 14977 with the addition of regular expression-style repetition.

## Syntax

A "team file" is a list of six Pok&eacute;mon representations separated by two
newlines. A Pok&eamon; must be represented as an entry declaration followed by a
set of statements separated by newlines. A statement defines an attribute of a
Pok&eacute;mon. All statements are optional. A statement can be of eight types:

* "EV" Statement
* "IV" Statement
* "Shiny" Statement
* "Ability" Statement
* "Level" Statement
* "Happiness" Statement
* "Nature" Statement
* "Moves" Statement

As such, a team file can be represented with the following EBNF:

```ebnf
newline = '\n' | '\r\n';

team_file = (pokemon newline newline){1,6};
pokemon = entry_declaration (statement)*;

statement = ev_statement |
          = iv_statement |
          = shiny_statement |
          = ability_statement |
          = level_statement |
          = happiness_statement |
          = nature_statement |
          = moves_statement;
```

EBNF for `entry_declaration` and `*_statement` are below.

### Entry declaration

An entry declaration defines basic information about the Pok&eacute;mon &mdash;
species, held item, nickname, and gender. It can take two forms. The first is
used when a nickname is not specified. It consists of a species, followed by
optionally 'M' (to indicate a male gender) or 'F' (to indicate a female gender)
in parentheses after a space, and if an item is specified, a space, at sign,
space, and the item name. The second is used when a nickname is specified. It
consists of the nickname, a space, the species in parentheses, optionally a
space and the gender identifier in parentheses, and optionally a space, at sign,
space, and an item name.

The EBNF for this is as follows:

```ebnf
gender = "M"
         "F"

entry_declaration = nickname " (" species ")" (" (" gender ")")? (" @ " item)? |
                    species (" (" gender ")")? (" @ " item)?;
```

For brevity, the EBNF for `nickname`, `species`, and `item` are omitted.

### "EV" Statement

This type of statement defines the effort values of the Pok&eacute;mon. It is
specified as a literal "EVs: " followed by HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack,
Special Defense, and Speed separated by a literal " / ". By default, this is set
to `0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0`.

The EBNF for this is as follows:

```ebnf
number_list = num " / " num " / " num " / " num " / " num " / " num;
ev_statement = "EVs: " number_list;
```

For brevity, the EBNF for `num` is omitted.

### "IV" Statement

This is identical to an "EV" Statement, though instead of a literal "EVs" there
is a literal "IVs". By default, this is set to `31 / 31 / 31 / 31 / 31 / 31`.

The EBNF for this is as follows:

```ebnf
iv_statement: "IVs: " number_list;
```

See above for the EBNF for `number_list`.

### "Shiny" Statement

This determines the shininess of the Pok&eacute;mon. It is a literal "Shiny: "
followed by a boolean "Yes" or "No." By default, it is `No`.

The EBNF for this is as follows:

```ebnf
boolean = "Yes" |
          "No";

shiny_statement = "Shiny: " boolean;
```

### "Ability" Statement

This determines the ability of the Pok&eacute;mon. It is a literal "Ability: "
followed by the ability of the Pok&eacute;mon. By default, it is the
Pok&eacute;mon's first ability.

The EBNF for this is as follows:

```ebnf
ability_statement = "Ability: " ability;
```
For brevity, the EBNF for `ability` is omitted.

### "Level" Statement

This determines the level of the Pok&eacute;mon. It is a literal "Level: "
followed by a number between 1 and 100.

The EBNF for this is as follows:

```ebnf
level_statement = "Level: " num;
```

### "Happiness" Statement

This determines the happiness value of the Pok&eacute;mon. It is a literal
"Happiness: " followed by a number between 0 and 255. By default, it is 255.

The EBNF for this is as follows:

```ebnf
happiness_statement = "Happiness: " num;
```

### "Nature" Statement

This determines the nature of the Pok&eacute;mon. It is the nature of the
Pok&eacute;mon followed by a literal " Nature".

The EBNF for this is as follows:

```ebnf
nature_statement = nature " Nature";
```

For brevity, the EBNF for `nature` is omitted.

### "Moves" Statement

A move is a literal "-" or "- " followed by one or more move names separated by
" / ". For moves like Hidden Power, a type may be specified by a literal " "
followed by a type name or a literal " [" followed by a type name and a literal
"]". A moves statement is up to four moves.

The EBNF for this is as follows:

```ebnf
move_start = "-" | "- ";
move = move_start (move_name " / ")* move_name;
moves_statement = move{1,4};
```
