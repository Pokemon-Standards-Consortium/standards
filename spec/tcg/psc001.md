# PSC 001: Identification of card expansions

## Overview

* **Scope:** TCG releases by Wizards of the Coast, Nintendo, Pokémon USA, and/or
  The Pokémon Company International.
* **Desired outcome:** Ability to uniquely identify each expansion using a common
  format.

## Background

There has been very little agreement on how expansions are identified. For
instance:

* RK9 Labs uses TK10A to refer to the Alolan Raichu deck, while Pokémon TCG
  Online uses TK10A to refer to the Lycanroc deck.
* Pokémon TCG Online uses TK6A and TK6B to refer to the Noibat & Sylveon
  Trainer Kit, while the PokeGym Researching Tower uses TK5 to refer to these.
* The PokeGym Researching Tower uses TR to refer to the Team Rocket expansion,
  while PkmnCards uses TR to refer to the EX Team Rocket Returns expansion.
