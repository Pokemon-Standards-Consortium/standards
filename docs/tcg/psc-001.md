# PSC 001 EARLY DRAFT

## Overview
* Scope: TCG releases by Wizards of the Coast, Nintendo, Pokémon USA, and/or The Pokémon Company International
* Desired outcome: Ability to uniquely identify each expansion using a common format

## Background
There has been some confusion around set codes/abbreviations, which is making it really complicated to easily allow use of the Compendium's new API (which allows for rulings to be pulled by card) for various projects. Some examples:
* RK9 Labs uses TK10A to refer to the Alolan Raichu deck, while the Pokémon TCG Online uses TK10A to refer to the Lycanroc deck.
* The Pokémon TCG Online uses TK6A and TK6B to refer to the Noibat & Sylveon Trainer Kit, while the PokeGym Researching Tower uses TK5 to refer to these.
* The PokeGym Researching Tower uses TR to refer to the Team Rocket expansion, PkmnCards uses TR to refer to the EX Team Rocket Returns expansion.
